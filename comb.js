//Step 1: Write 3 lines of code as a const
//Step 2: Give each const a different variable
//Step 3: Create a equation that will end up with the correct number for each
const first = 5 + 5;
const second = 2 * 20;
const last = 40 - 1;
//Step 4: Creat 3 console logs so I can test the strings to make sure they all end up correct and will show
console.log(first);
console.log(second);
console.log(last);

//Step 5: Create a alert
//Step 6: Type in the message that is required
//Step 7: Insert literal templates including the string as the end
//Step 8: Surroudn the text with back ticks so the literal templates work


alert(`You have recieved this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination: ${first} - ${second} - ${last}`);

//Step 9: run the code in both terminal and goLive to make sure it works
